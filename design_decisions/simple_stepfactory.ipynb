    "By contrast to earlier designs, create_step does not require a step_config to be passed here as an argument. This simplify the interface considerably because we don't have to worry about getting the right type of step_config for a given step_type. The problem is that while we can simply *return more specific* step types in subclasses (such as a ProcessingStep instead of a ConfigurableRetryStep), we can**not** require a *more specific argument* for subclasses (for example requiring a ProcessingStepConfig for a ProcessingStepFactory), as this would violate the Liskov Substitution Principal.\n",

    "- The end goal is simply to have an object that satisfies the (ConfigurableRetry)StepInterface. From the perspective of the pipeline, we don't care what type of step it is.\n",
    "- The initial reason for looking into leveraging generics was for making sure that we are passing the right config for a given type of step. However, after a lot of trial and error, I still did not find a good way to create a simple class hierarchy based on what the Sagemaker SDK makes available to us. Instead, it looks more promising to simply create a very minimal interface for step factories, and later specific implementations decide what the best way to create that kind of step is.\n",
    "  - Downside: let's reuse of code between different step factories. This makes it somewhat harder to get started with creating new step factories, because there is less structure imposed for how exactly to do it.\n",
    "  - Upside: more flexibility for grading step factories. This may actually make it easier to create new step factories, and it will make it easier to maintain given step factories as the interface of the Sagemaker SDK changes.\n",

This will not only make the intent of this method more clear, but it will also make it easier to have a single config façade that abstracts what config's are global and what are step-specific (step config simply need a reference to the shared config, so they can fall back to that if necessary, but the concrete logic can be implemented differently for each step type).
