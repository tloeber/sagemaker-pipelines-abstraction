However, it currently looks like having access to nesting would allow for a substantial reduction in code complexity (especially for the step factories), so I'm planning to **switch to JSON**."

    "For now, I'm breaking up the configs into a separate file for each environment. While there are some config values that could be shared across environments, this would introduce too much additional complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the medium-term, the goal is to find a way to share config values that we want to be the same across environments, especially those that need to be the same in order to avoid unexpected differences in behavior â€“ e.g. step type (if it does come from a config - ideally we would avoid such potential sources of bugs altogether, such as by making the step type a property of a given processor).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main way to achieve this goal would be by splitting up the config into a **template** (which can directly set shared values) and use **parameters**  which are populated from a different file (one for each env). Note that the downside of this approach would be that it creates one more file across which configs are scattered, but hopefully this will be offset by the fact that the configs will be more organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Todo: Look into ways how to implement this:\n",
    "- Simple way: Set shared values in a config file, and load an additional .env file that differs by environment\n",
    "  - Downsides: \n",
    "    - Doesn't allow parameter substitution (e.g., change prefix or postfix of a role name or bucket name) - have to set whole value.\n",
    "    - Doesn't easily allow nested config for anything that differs by environment (since we are bound by the limitations of .env files)\n",
    "- Use a Terraform template file \n",
    "  - Downsides:\n",
    "    - Have to see how usable that is for local development. (Worst case, we can resort to use pydantic's ability to override all the settings using environment variables for local development; though that too would become tedious if many of the configs are nested)."
