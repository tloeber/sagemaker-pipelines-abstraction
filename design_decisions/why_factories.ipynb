    "Short answer: Employing the factory method pattern allows us to **decouple the pipeline from the specific steps**: Both depend only on a shared interface (how to create a step from the factory, and how to run a given step). However, the pipeline does not have to know any more details about which kind of step it is running. This also gives the user the ability to extend the application  (such as to add new types of steps). "
